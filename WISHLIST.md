# Add here your wishes or ideas how this app can be improved ðŸ¤ª

#### ðŸ’¡ #1 Add something like "Conference config" on the backend
With data like:
- conference starting date (needed for Home counter)
- maybe some more..

---

#### ðŸ’¡ #2 The About page should take data from the backend (with photos)

---

#### ðŸ’¡ #3 Switch to historical conferences
In the menu there should be a list of all available historical conferences, so users could switch to the previous ones (we have the data on the backend starting from 2018).

---

#### ðŸ’¡ #4 Voting on the best conferences
It can be voting, rating or clapping.

---

#### ðŸ’¡ #5 Multiple tracks
Allow multiple track display on the schedule

---

#### ðŸ’¡ #6 Multiple speakers for the same presentation
